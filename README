shtickerpack is a tool that makes working with Corporate Clash phase files easy. No more tedious command execution or double-checking the right flags - unpack and repack phase files in a single click!

I'm not affiliated with Disney or the Corporate Clash team in any way (although I do wish I were!). shtickerpack doesn't interact with the Corporate Clash launcher, client, or server in any way - it simply automates commands that would otherwise be done in the terminal. I don't have any access to your data, nor to what you're doing with shtickerbook. Be responsible, but bold.
