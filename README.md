# shtickerpack

shtickerpack is a tool that makes working with Corporate Clash phase files easy. No more tedious command execution, double-checking the right flags, or restructuring the phase folders - unpack and repack content packs in just a few click!

I'm not affiliated with Disney or the Corporate Clash team in any way (although I do wish I were!). shtickerpack doesn't interact with the Corporate Clash launcher, client, or server in any way - it simply automates commands that would otherwise be done in the terminal or manually in the filesystem. I don't have any access to your data, nor to what you're doing with shtickerbook. Be responsible.

If you used shtickerpack to create a content pack or just explore the phase files, I'd love to know :) While you aren't required to cite shtickerpack, I'll really appreciate if you give the project a shoutout if you found it useful.
