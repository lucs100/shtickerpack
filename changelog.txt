v1.1 - November 3, 2023
Focus on major performance improvements! Details:
* Unpacks and repacks now run in the backround instead of freezing the app temporarily.
* Merged repack warning popups into a single popup. This is still a bit ugly right now, but a fix is in development.


v1.0 - October 23, 2023
Initial release of shtickerpack! Supports:
* Unpacking .mf files. Automatically tries to locate a Clash installation to do so.
* Repacking loose asset files to a single .mf file, with folders stacked as required for Clash.
